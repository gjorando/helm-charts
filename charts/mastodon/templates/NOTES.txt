We recommend reading more about configuring your Mastodon instance via the official documentation: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/

Asset precompilation and database migrations should be automatically performed with Kubernetes jobs. However, should you need to execute a command on your instance, you can do so with the following command:

  $ kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} exec -it deployment/mastodon-web -- <command>
